## Bottle Flip Physics Lab
*A tiny HTML project that grew from ratios into physics - with a little help from AI*

## 🌱 How this started
This project began as a simple Grade 6 **math assignment about ratios** and a concern about someone throwing a full water bottle around.

The original idea was straightforward: adjust the water level in a bottle, flip it, and record the success ratio.
A few numbers, a few observations - classic elementary school math.

But as I started thinking about how to make the experiment interactive, I realized it should be something more dynamic than a worksheet. I wanted sliders and motion while my alpha tester wanted a bottle that behaved like a real one.

This was my first attempt at building something in HTML.
So I opened a blank Notepad ++ file, asked an AI assistant a few questions, and started learning.
That was the beginning.

## 🤖 Learning HTML with AI
This project became my first real foray into **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** - and I built it with the help of AI as a kind of interactive tutor.

Instead of following a rigid tutorial, I learned by:
- asking small, targeted questions
- experimenting with code
- breaking things (indenting was tough to follow in Notepad ++)
- fixing them
- and slowly building a mental model of how Canvas physics works

AI helped me understand *how* to write it - with a few AI quirks, of course.
It was like having a patient programming partner who could explain concepts, suggest improvements, and help me debug when I got stuck. And that made the whole process surprisingly fun.

## 💡 The surprising part
What started as a math project turned into a full little physics lab:
- a bottle with a dynamic center of mass
- torque from grip height
- spin and angular momentum
- collision detection using rotated bounding boxes
- dust puffs on impact
- upright vs. cap‑landing success logic
- a scoring system
- a wobble‑settle animation
- and a UI that lets you experiment with all of it

All of this fits into **20 KB**.

As someone used to scientific modeling and exploration workflows, it was really fun to see how much expression and interactivity could emerge from a tiny, self‑contained HTML file. It reminded me that simple tools can be incredibly powerful when paired with curiosity.

## 🎮 What this project is
This is a self‑contained Bottle Flip Lab built entirely with:
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**
- **Canvas 2D**

Just open the file and it runs.

It’s meant to be:
- a math tool for exploring ratios and probability
- a physics tool for exploring torque, rotation, and center of mass
- a playful experiment for kids
- a curiosity‑driven project for anyone who likes seeing ideas come alive

## 🧪 Try it
Open the lab directly in your browser:

Or download the file and run it offline — it works anywhere  
(although my testing was done on Google Chrome).

## 📊 Why this matters for math
Even though the project grew into physics, the original math goal is still here:
- success : attempts
- upright : cap landings
- simplified ratios
- percentage success
- sensitivity to variable changes

It’s a hands‑on way to explore how ratios behave when the underlying system is dynamic and a little unpredictable - just like real experiments.

## 🚀 Future updates
A few ideas I’m considering:
- **Improved bottle landings**  
  The alpha tester says that the bottle needs to wobble more when it lands.
- **Test Throw Mode**  
  Run 10, 20, or 50 simulated flips instantly to explore ratios and probability.
- **Slow‑motion replay**  
  For teaching angular momentum and center‑of‑mass shifts.
- **Challenge mode**  
  “Can you tune the sliders to reach a 70% success rate?”

These aren’t implemented, but they could be part of the project’s natural evolution.

## 🧭 Why I’m sharing this
Because this little project reminded me of something important:  
**A massive codebase isn't needed to make something meaningful.**

Sometimes 20 KB is enough to teach a concept, spark curiosity, make someone smile, or inspire someone to code - my little Grade 6 student made a life simulator.

And sometimes, learning something new - like HTML - is easier when you let curiosity lead and let AI help you explore the path.
